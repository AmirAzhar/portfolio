              Hi! My name is{" "}
              <span className="hightlightedText">Amir Azhar</span> and welcome
              to my personal website! I am a Software Engineer who loves web
              development, starting from back in 2019. It all started when I
              wanted to create a website as a virtual gift for my girlfriend
              (now fianc√©e!) during the Covid-19 lockdown!
              <br />
              <br />I have a very strong interest in frontend web development.
              Despite not being enrolled in any web development modules in{" "}
              <span className="hightlightedText">
                National University of Singapore (NUS),{" "}
              </span>
              I taught myself various skills and tools, starting from plain
              CSS/HTML/Javascript, to now being proficient in industry prominent
              technologies such as React, Next.js, Angular and many more!
              <br />
              <br />I am now employed full-time as a Software Engineer at{" "}
              <span className="hightlightedText">VISA Singapore, </span>
              but I am continuously looking out for more opportunities to grow
              and develop myself into a "T-shaped" individual!
